# ImageMasher
AUTHOR: Will Jenkins 2019

A GUI javafx program that calculates the average value of each overlapping pixel in a stack of jpg images and
creates a jpeg based on the resultant pixels.

Project is currently in-progress. The GUI, and image loader are functioning. The processing has yet to be implemented. 

I have a prototype of the code built, I just need to implement it when I have some time. School keeps me pretty busy at
the moment.
